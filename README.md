# provider_state_management

A new Flutter project.
Provider is a Flutter package used for state management.

It is built on top of InheritedWidget (a Flutter widget that allows data sharing down the widget tree).

It helps you share data (state) across your app and rebuild only the widgets that need it when the data changes.

## Getting Started
# 🚀 Flutter App with Provider State Management (MVVM)

This project demonstrates how to build a Flutter app using the **Provider** package for state management, based on the **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** design pattern.  

It ensures a **clean, testable, and scalable** codebase by separating the UI (View) from the business logic (ViewModel).
